Two's Company Dating Agency - 
Auckland's most selective dating service since 2003


Take the time and effort out of meeting eligible, professional single people, with Two's Company Auckland dating service. 
Meeting single people who share your values and interests can be like finding a needle in a haystack. And it's especially difficult when you're living a full life as it is. As a successful professional, you just don't have time for the 'hit and miss' approach to dating that you find at singles events or internet dating sites.

So wouldn't it be great to have someone to do the searching for you - someone who really knows what type of person you're looking for. You need a matchmaker who 'gets' you, and can match you to your equal, rather than setting you up with a string of unsuitable dates.

Your personal introduction agency
When you join Two's Company Auckland dating service, you'll have the opportunity to meet like-minded single people who have been personally matched with you - by a person, not a computer.

Because Two's Company is all about quality, rather than quantity, we spend time finding the right person for you to date. The people you're matched with are all personally selected and screened for you, so you only go on dates with people who live up to your expectations. Whilst we can't guarantee chemsitry or attraction we do have a 90% success rate when it comes to positive feedback after first dates.

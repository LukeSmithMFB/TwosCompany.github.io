      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two&amp;rsquo;s Company Dating Agency -
Auckland&amp;rsquo;s most selective dating service since 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time and effort out of meeting eligible, professional single people, with Two&amp;rsquo;s Company Auckland dating service.
Meeting single people who share your values and interests can be like finding a needle in a haystack. And it&amp;rsquo;s especially difficult when you&amp;rsquo;re living a full life as it is. As a successful professional, you just don&amp;rsquo;t have time for the &amp;lsquo;hit and miss&amp;rsquo; approach to dating that you find at singles events or internet dating sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to have someone to do the searching for you - someone who really knows what type of person you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. You need a matchmaker who &amp;lsquo;gets&amp;rsquo; you, and can match you to your equal, rather than setting you up with a string of unsuitable dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your personal introduction agency
When you join Two&amp;rsquo;s Company Auckland dating service, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to meet like-minded single people who have been personally matched with you - by a person, not a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Two&amp;rsquo;s Company is all about quality, rather than quantity, we spend time finding the right person for you to date. The people you&amp;rsquo;re matched with are all personally selected and screened for you, so you only go on dates with people who live up to your expectations. Whilst we can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee chemsitry or attraction we do have a 90% success rate when it comes to positive feedback after first dates.&lt;/p&gt;
